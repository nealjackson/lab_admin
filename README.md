# lab_admin

This is the scheduling software for Physics lab.

Instructions: download all the files, fill in the lab_people file and run python lab_sched.py.
              output files should be the lab schedule (as a pdf if you have pdflatex), and a
              CSV file of contract hours (25 entries, week 0 followed by 2x12 semester weeks).
